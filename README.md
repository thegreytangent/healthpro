# HealthPro Forecast

## Project Title: HealthPro Forecast: A Predictive Health Analytics System

### Development Team:
- Samano, Rajel Johann
- Genolos, Geovan Canieso
- Repeso, Allysa Khae Sorote

### Situation/Problem/Opportunity:
In certain locations, there is considerable data available regarding previous illnesses. We have the technology to gather and understand this information. People are starting to realize how important it is to predict and get ready for health issues. But there's a problem - our healthcare usually reacts to problems only after they happen. This can lead to using resources in a not-so-efficient way and being surprised by sudden health issues. The good part is, we can fix this by using HealthPro Forecast: A Predictive Health Analytics developed by the students of Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod. This means we can predict future health problems and get ready for them. It helps us use our healthcare resources better and plan ahead. So, instead of just reacting to problems, we can be more prepared and take actions early. This not only helps in emergencies but also improves the overall health of the community by using data to make smart decisions.

### Objectives:
The system goals are pretty straightforward. We want to use all the information we have about past sicknesses in our area. Then, we'll use this info to figure out what sickness might come up in the next month. The big idea is to be ready for any health issues before they even happen. So, we aim to predict what might come and get everything set up in advance. This way, we can make sure we use our healthcare resources wisely and can help people before things get too bad. The goal is to be smart about it, use data to plan ahead, and keep our community healthier.

### Scope:
The system has been developed by San-Agustin is just focusing in one area â€“ the city or barangay where the system will be implemented. We'll gather information about sicknesses/diseases that happened here before. Then, we'll use this information to guess what sickness might happen in the next month. It's all about being ready for anything that might affect our health. We're not trying to cover the whole world, just our community. Again, the goal is to optimize the allocation of healthcare resources and enhance the effectiveness of interventions by utilizing data-driven insights for timely responses.

### System Overview:
The HealthPro Forecast system is built using the Laravel PHP framework, developed by the students of Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod. It focuses on using data to understand and predict health issues in a specific area, whether it's a city or barangay. The system begins by collecting and encoding information about past illnesses, creating a historical database. This data becomes the foundation for predictive analysis, helping forecast potential health issues that might arise in the next month. Operating on a proactive principle, the system aims to prepare for health challenges in advance. Once predictions are in place, strategic planning of healthcare resource allocation ensures readiness to address emerging issues. The overall goal is to create a more efficient and data-driven approach to healthcare management within the community.

### Requirements:
The application is written using the Laravel PHP framework, ensuring robustness, scalability, and efficiency in web development. Laravel's features facilitate the creation of a web-based application that seamlessly integrates with predictive analytics functionalities. With Laravel, the HealthPro Forecast system can provide a user-friendly interface while ensuring stability and security. This choice of technology aligns with the project's objectives of optimizing healthcare resource allocation and enhancing community health through data-driven insights.
